# What is Eden?

Eden is the Event Driven ENvironment.  It's an exploratory operating environment intended to help me research the requirements for a completely event-driven operating system.  My goal is something which is kind of like GEOS, but more open-ended (e.g., easier to extend to support more kinds of events, etc.).
